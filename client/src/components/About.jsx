          Calculating CGPA and GPA manually is tough. You have to track credit
          hours, marks, and quality points, which can get confusing and
          time-consuming. I noticed many students struggle with this, and
          existing tools often have gaps. So, I created a simple tool to help
          University of Agriculture students calculate their CGPA and GPA
          easily.
